# Password Strength Tester

This project is a web-based tool that tests the strength of passwords. It analyzes various factors such as length, complexity, and the inclusion of special characters to determine the strength level of a given password.

## Features

- Real-time password strength analysis
- Visual strength meter
- Feedback on how to improve password strength
- Tips for creating strong passwords

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Python (Flask framework)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-strength-tester.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd password-strength-tester
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5000`
3. Enter a password in the input field to see its strength analysis

## How It Works

The password strength is calculated based on the following criteria:
- Length of the password
- Presence of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Inclusion of numbers
- Use of special characters
- Entropy calculation for additional complexity measure

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the project are welcome.
